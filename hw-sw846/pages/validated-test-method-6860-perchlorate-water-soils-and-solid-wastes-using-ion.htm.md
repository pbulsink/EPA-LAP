# Validated Test Method 6860: Perchlorate in Water, Soils and Solid Wastes Using Ion Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry (IC/ESI/MS or IC/ESI/MS/MS)  


The following document details the method which uses ion chromatography
(IC) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) or
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine the level of perchlorate
in surface water, groundwater, salt water and soil. This method has been
validated and is available for use but has not yet been formally in
incorporated into [the SW-846 Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium).
Please refer to the [SW-846 Validated Methods
page](/hw-sw846/validated-test-methods-recommended-waste-testing) for
more information.
