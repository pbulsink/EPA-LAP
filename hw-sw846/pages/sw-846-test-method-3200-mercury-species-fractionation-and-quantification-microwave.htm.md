# SW-846 Test Method 3200: Mercury Species Fractionation and Quantification by Microwave Assisted Extraction, Selective Solvent Extraction and/or Solid Phase Extraction  


This method contains a sequential extraction and separation procedure
that maybe used in conjunction with a determinative method to
differentiate mercury species that are present in soils and sediments.
This method provides information on both total mercury and various
mercury species.
