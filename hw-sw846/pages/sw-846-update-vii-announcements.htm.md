[Modernizing Ignitable Liquids Determination
Rule](/hw-sw846/final-rule-modernizing-ignitable-liquids-determinations)
:::
:::::

EPA released Update VII to the SW-846 compendium of methods.

**On this Page:**

-   [Phase I - Modernizing Ignitable Liquids

-   [Phase II - PFAS Methods 3512 and 8327](#PhaseII8327)

        8327] ](#fqs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase I - Modernizing Ignitable Liquids Determination

EPA finalized changes to the hazardous waste regulations that modernize
how the hazardous waste characteristic of ignitability is determined
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. These amendments allow
for the use of modern equipment and techniques for making ignitability
determinations for waste. The final rulemaking also allows the use of
non-mercury thermometers in a variety of EPA's analytical methods that
currently require mercury thermometers. These changes reduce potential
mercury exposures to humans and the environment by reducing the overall
use of mercury-containing products.

EPA sought input on the proposal in a 60-day public comment period that
ended on June 3, 2019. EPA carefully considered all the comments before
issuing the final rulemaking, which was signed on June 8, 2020.

SW-846 Methods 3512 and 8327 were validated together for 24 Per- and
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in surface water, groundwater, and
wastewater, and final versions were published in the SW-846 Compendium
on July 30, 2021 and are available for use:

[Method
3512](/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-3512-solvent-dilution-non-potable-waters)
is a rapid preparation method for non-potable waters wherein samples are
diluted (1:1) with a water-miscible organic solvent (methanol), mixed,
filtered through a particle filter (0.2 µm), and adjusted with acetic
acid (0.1% by volume) prior to determinative analysis.

[Method
8327](/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-8327-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-liquid-chromatographytandem)
is used for determination of selected PFAS in prepared samples or sample
extracts using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS).  A liquid chromatography column with a \~2 µm particle size
stationary phase provides exceptional chromatographic resolution, and
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) provides a high degree of specificity
and sensitivity. This method was validated using negative electrospray
ionization and external standard calibration.

### Frequent Questions for Methods 3512 and 8327

**1.  Method 8327, "Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances by Liquid
Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)", is published as an
external standard calibration method. Is isotope dilution calibration
permitted to be used for quantitative analysis?**

Method 8327 was validated as an external standard calibration method.
The [Methods Innovation
Rule](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule-mir) identifies
SW-846 methods for non-Method Defined Parameters, including Method 8327,
as guidance. Appropriate modifications may be made to these methods,
including the use of an alternate calibration model, as long as the
laboratory demonstrates it can generate data of appropriate quality for
the intended application and the modifications are acceptable and
transparent to the end data user (e.g., regulatory authority). Please
refer to Section 9.0 for categories of quality controls and associated
acceptance criteria, and refer to the client or end data user for
project-specific Data Quality Objectives.

*Note:* *The preparation and analysis method modifications that would be
needed to support the use of isotope dilution/extracted internal
standard calibration are not explicitly identified in either method.
SW-846 Method 8000D provides some details about these calibration
models. A laboratory should document all method modifications and
provide to the end data user for their consideration.*

**2.  SW-846 Method 8327, "Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by
Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)," provides a
recommended maximum holding time for aqueous samples to be used as a
guideline. Why did EPA not specify a required maximum holding time?**

At the time Method 8327 was published, EPA had not completed a formal
holding time study in non-potable water samples for the target analytes
included in the method. Section 8.2 of Method 8327 recommends a maximum
holding time of 14 days from sample collection to preparation and
refrigerated (0-6ºC) storage as a guideline, and it recommends frozen
storage to extend holding times beyond 14 days. These recommendations
may be updated once a formal holding time study is published.  

Chapter 4 of SW-846 which contains a table with recommended containers,
preservations, and holding times for organic analytes, does not directly
address PFAS, but it does state that sample handling and preservation
guidelines are intended to maintain sample integrity and improve
stability of organic chemicals in the sample matrix between collection
and laboratory preparation and analysis. EPA intends to add PFAS-related
information to a future revision of Chapter 4, including recommended
sample containers, preservation and holding times.
