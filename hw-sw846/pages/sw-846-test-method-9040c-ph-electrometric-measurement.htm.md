# SW-846 Test Method 9040C: pH Electrometric Measurement  


The following document provides information on the procedure to measure
the pH of aqueous wastes and those multiphase wastes where the aqueous
phase constitutes at least 20% of the total volume of the waste.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
page](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule).
