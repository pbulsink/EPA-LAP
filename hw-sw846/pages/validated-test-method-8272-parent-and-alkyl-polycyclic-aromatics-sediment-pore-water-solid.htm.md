# Validated Test Method 8272: Parent and Alkyl Polycyclic Aromatics in Sediment Pore Water by Solid-Phase Microextraction and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry in Selected Ion Monitoring Mode  


The following document describes the method for separation of pore water
from PAH-impacted sediment samples, the removal of colloids, and the
subsequent measurement of dissolved concentrations of PAHs. This method
has been validated and is available for use but has not yet been
formally in incorporated into [the SW-846
Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium). Please refer to the [SW-846
Validated Methods
page](/hw-sw846/validated-test-methods-recommended-waste-testing) for
more information.
