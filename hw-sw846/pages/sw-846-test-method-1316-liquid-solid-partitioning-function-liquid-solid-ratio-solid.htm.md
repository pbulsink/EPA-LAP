# SW-846 Test Method 1316: Liquid-Solid Partitioning as a Function of Liquid-to-Solid Ratio in Solid Materials Using a Parallel Batch Procedure  


This method is one of four Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework
(LEAF) methods. It is designed to provide the liquid-solid partitioning
(LSP) of inorganic and non-volatile organic constituents at the natural
pH of the solid material as a function of liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S)
under conditions that approach liquid-solid chemical equilibrium.

More information about the LEAF, including a detailed "How-To" Guide,
can be found on the [LEAF web
page](/hw-sw846/leaching-environmental-assessment-framework-leaf-methods-and-guidance).
