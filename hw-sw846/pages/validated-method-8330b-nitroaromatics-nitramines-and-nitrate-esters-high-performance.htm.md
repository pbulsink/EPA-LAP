# Validated Method 8330B: Nitroaromatics, Nitramines, and Nitrate Esters by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)  


The following document discusses the method for the trace analysis of
explosives and propellant residues by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) using a dual wavelength ultraviolet (UV)
detector. This method has been validated and is available for use but
has not yet been formally in incorporated into [the SW-846
Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium). Please refer to the [SW-846
