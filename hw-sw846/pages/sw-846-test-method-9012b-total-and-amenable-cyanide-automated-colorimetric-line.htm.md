# SW-846 Test Method 9012B: Total and Amenable Cyanide (Automated Colorimetric, With Off-Line Distillation)  


The following document provides information on the method used to
determine the concentration of inorganic cyanides that are present as
either soluble salts or complexes in wastes or leachate.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
