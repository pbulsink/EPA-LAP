This document provides information on Method 1320, which is designed to
simulate the leaching that a waste will undergo from repetitive
precipitation of acid rain on an improperly designed sanitary landfill.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
