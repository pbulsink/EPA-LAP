# SW-846 Test Method 9071B: n-Hexane Extractable Material (HEM) for Sludge, Sediment, and Solid Samples  


The following document provides information on the procedure used to
quantify low concentrations of oil and grease in soil, sediments,
sludges, and other solid materials amenable to chemical drying and
solvent extraction.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
page](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule).
