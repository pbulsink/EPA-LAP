# Referred Air Method 25E: Determination of a Vapor Phase Organic Concentration in Waste Samples  


This method is applicable for determining the vapor pressure of waste.
The headspace vapor of the sample is analyzed for carbon content by a
headspace analyzer, which uses a flame ionization detector (FID).

This method was developed and promulgated by EPA's Emissions
Measurement Center.
