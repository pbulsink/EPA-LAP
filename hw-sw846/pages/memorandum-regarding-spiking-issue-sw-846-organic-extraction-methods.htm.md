# Memorandum Regarding the Spiking Issue in SW-846 Organic Extraction Methods  

This memorandum recommends that SW-846 users not follow the cautionary notes in Section 9.3.1 of [Method 3500C](/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-3500c-organic-extraction-and-sample-preparation) (organic extraction and sample preparation), Section 11.5 of [Method 3545A](/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-3545a-pressurized-fluid-extraction-pfe) (pressurized fluid extraction, and Section 11.3 of [Method 3550C](/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-3550c-ultrasonic-extraction) (ultrasonic extraction). Instead of adding surrogates and spike compounds to samples before adding drying agents, SW-846 users should spike samples AFTER adding drying agents to prevent low recoveries for certain semi-volatile and non-volatile organic compounds.Â
