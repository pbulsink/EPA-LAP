# Validated Test Method 8323: Determination of Organotins by Micro-Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry  


The following document discusses the method that covers the use of
solid-phase extraction (SPE) discs, solvent extractions, and
micro-liquid chromatography coupled with  electrospray ion trap mass
spectrometry (ES-ITMS). This method has been validated and is available
for use but has not yet been formally in incorporated into [the SW-846
Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium). Please refer to the [SW-846
Validated Methods
page](/hw-sw846/validated-test-methods-recommended-waste-testing) for
more information.
