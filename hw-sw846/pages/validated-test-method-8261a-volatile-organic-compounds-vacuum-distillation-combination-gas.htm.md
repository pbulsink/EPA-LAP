# Validated Test Method 8261A: Volatile Organic Compounds by Vacuum Distillation in Combination with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (VD/GC/MS)  


The following document describes the method to determine the
concentrations of volatile organic compounds and some low-boiling
semivolatile organic compounds. This method has been validated and is
available for use but has not yet been formally in incorporated
into [the SW-846 Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium). Please refer
