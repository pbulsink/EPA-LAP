# SW-846 Test Method 8276: Toxaphene and Toxaphene Congeners By Gas Chromatography/Negative Ion Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (GC-NICI/MS)  


This method is used to determine the concentrations of various toxaphene
congeners (see table below) and technical toxaphene (along with the
possible addition of other toxaphene congeners and compounds from Method
8081) in extracts from solid and liquid matrices, using fused-silica,
open-tubular capillary columns with negative ion chemical ionization
mass spectrometry (NICI/MS).
