# SW-846 Test Method 9010C: Total and Amenable Cyanide: Distillation  


The following document provides information on the method to extract
soluble cyanide salts and many insoluble cyanide complexes from wastes
and leachates, designed to address the problem of "trace" analyses.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
page](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule).
