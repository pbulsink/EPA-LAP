# SW-846 Test Method 8290A: Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDFs) by High-Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)  


This method provides procedures for the detection and quantitative
measurement of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (tetra- through
octachlorinated homologues; PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans
(tetra- through octachlorinated homologues; PCDFs) in a variety of
environmental matrices and at part-per-trillion (ppt) to
part-per-quadrillion (ppq) concentrations.Â
