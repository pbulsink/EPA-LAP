# Validated Test Method 8170: Assay of Chemical Agents in Solid and Aqueous Samples by Gas Chromatography/Flame Photometric Detection (GC/FPD)  


The following document describes the analysis of chemical agents in
aqueous and solid samples by GC/FPD and has been applied to concrete,
charcoal, wood, water, brine, ash, coral, sand, and soil. This method
has been validated and is available for use but has not yet been
formally in incorporated into [the SW-846
