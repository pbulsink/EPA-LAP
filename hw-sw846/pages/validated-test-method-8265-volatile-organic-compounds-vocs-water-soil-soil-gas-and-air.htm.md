# Validated Test Method 8265: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Water, Soil, Soil Gas, and Air by Direct Sampling Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry (DSITMS)  


The following document describes Method 8265, which uses DSITMS for the
rapid measurement, continuous monitoring, and preliminary screening of
VOCs in water, soil, soil gas, and air. This method has been validated
and is available for use but has not yet been formally in incorporated
into [the SW-846 Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium). Please refer
