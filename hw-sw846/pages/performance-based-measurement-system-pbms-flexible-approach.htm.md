## What is the current process to promulgate SW-846 test methods?  

I understand the process has changed in promulgating SW-846 test
methods. How are they promulgated? When are they finally approved for
use?

Currently, many RCRA regulations specifically require the use of SW-846
methods. Methods are added to the SW-846 methods compendium by two ways.
Required methods are added to SW-846 through a formal rulemaking
process, in which the Agency follows the Action Development Process
(ADP), through which the agency seeks notice and comment. After the
comments are reviewed, the required method may be revised, based on
public comment. Then Agency will finalized the methods with a Final rule
after the designated comment period. Only after a final rule is
published are methods approved for use by the regulated community in
order to comply with RCRA regulations requiring the use of finalized
SW-846 methods. States may choose to adopt the required method(s).

For all other methods considered guidance, updates to SW-846 are
announced through a Notice of Availability (NOA). These validated
methods are made available to the public for comment. After comments are
evaluated, the agency will revise the method update appropriately. Once
the methods are finalized, the update is incorporated into the SW-846
method compendium.

## How can one determine when a non-required method is appropriate to use for compliance with RCRA in relation to the Methods Innovation Rule?  

How can one determine when a non-required method is appropriate to use
for compliance with RCRA in relation to the Methods Innovation Rule?

If the analysis that you wish to perform is not for one of the Method
Defined Parameters (MDPs) listed in 40 CFR §260.11, then you must
determine whether a method (whether SW-846 or not) is appropriate for
the analytical purpose. The Agency has written the following guidance in
the MIR for determining method appropriateness:

-   An appropriate method might be one published by:
-   EPA in a different manual or regulation;
-   Another government agency;
-   A voluntary standards setting organization; or
-   Other well-known source.

Appropriate methods are reliable and accepted as such in the scientific
community. These methods might include those published by the Agency or
other government entities using techniques that have documented
reliability (e.g., ASTM).

Appropriate methods generate effective data, known and of appropriate
quality for project-specific decisions.

When selecting an appropriate method to use, you must be able to
demonstrate and document that you are able to see the analyte of
concern, in the matrix of concern, at the level of concern.

In addition, before selecting an alternative method other than SW-846
for RCRA-related testing and monitoring activities, we recommend that
you discuss your plans with your regulating authority and the project
managers.

## Do the "flexible approach", performance based measurement system (PBMS), and/or Methods Innovation Rule (MIR) change the way prescriptive language is interpreted in SW-846 methods?  

The following statement from the Disclaimer for SW-846 provides specific
guidance for interpretation of must, should, etc.:

"EPA generally does not intend these methods to be overly prescriptive.
The words "shall," "must," or "require" are used to indicate
aspects of the method that are considered essential to its performance,
based on sound analytical practices (e.g., an instrument must be
calibrated before use). In contrast, the words "should," "may," or
"recommend" are used to provide guidance on aspects of the method that
are useful but not essential. This flexibility does not apply to those
Method Defined Parameters where the analytical result is wholly
dependent on the process used to make the measurement."

## What is the "flexible approach" for environmental measurement?  

In 2008, EPA gauged its progress towards achieving the goals of PBMS,
and redefined the steps needed to ensure continued progress. As a result
of this analysis, the Agency now believes that while it may be possible
to specify performance criteria in a manner that is independent of
methods, techniques, or instruments, the development of a single
protocol for the validation of all current and future measurements,
including measurements made with techniques yet to be invented, is
simply not possible. Accordingly, in February 2008 EPA introduced
flexible approaches for environmental measurement which capture the
Agency's experience of the past ten years and set the stage for future
progress.

Key goals for these flexible approaches are as follows:

1.  Increased emphasis on flexibility in choosing sampling and
    analytical approaches to meet regulatory requirements for
    measurements.
2.  Development of processes for validation that confirm that
    measurements meet quality requirements.
3.  Increased collaboration with stakeholders to develop validation
    processes for new measurement technology.
4.  Rapid assessment of new or modified technologies, methods and
    procedures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is EPA doing to implement a Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS)?  

Assuring the quality of environmental measurements is essential to
implementation of EPA's environmental programs, both regulatory and
voluntary. In a 1997 Notice of Intent, the Agency outlined a
"Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS)" concept that was
intended to "improve data quality and encourage advancement of
analytical technologies."

As part of EPA's effort to implement the PBMS approach, the following
actions were taken:

Incorporating the PBMS philosophy into new regulations.

Establishing data quality and performance requirements for RCRA-required
monitoring and including the requirements in the RCRA regulations, as
necessary, to assist the regulated community in method selection and
help assure successful PBMS implementation.

Developing new sampling and testing methodologies which are compatible
with the PBMS approach and encouraging use of those methods.

Fostering training and guidance to educate regulators and the regulated
community regarding the flexibility of PBMS, the inherent flexibility of
SW-846, and application of PBMS during RCRA-related monitoring.

Removing some of the required uses for SW-846 methods from RCRA
regulations, where the Agency believes these requirements are not
necessary (in order to facilitate PBMS implementation), and thus
removing regulatory barriers to the use of new and innovative
technologies for RCRA-related monitoring.

In 2008, EPA gauged its progress towards achieving the goals of PBMS,
and redefined the steps needed to ensure continued progress. As a result
of this analysis, the Agency now believes that while it may be possible
to specify performance criteria in a manner that is independent of
methods, techniques, or instruments, the development of a single
protocol for the validation of all current and future measurements,
including measurements made with techniques yet to be invented, is
simply not possible. Accordingly, in February 2008 EPA introduced
flexible approaches for environmental measurement which capture the
Agency's experience of the past ten years and set the stage for future
progress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are the benefits of EPA's Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS)?  

The PBMS approach would provide many benefits to both regulators and the
regulated community, including:

-   Flexibility in method selection.
-   Expedited approval of new and emerging technologies to meet mandated
    monitoring requirements.
-   Development and use of cost-effective methods that meet program
    requirements and their associated performance criteria.
-   Where PBMS is implemented, the regulated community will be able to
    select an appropriate analytical method for use in complying with
    the RCRA regulations, including a method not found in EPA-published
    manuals that is cost-effective and meets the particular project
    criteria.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How does EPA's Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS) approach affect SW-846?  

Due to the complexities in material and waste characterization in
support of RCRA, SW-846 functions under the Performance Based Approach
(PBMS), and flexibility (in choosing sampling and analytical approaches
to meet measurement requirements) is allowed when it is appropriate to
do so. PBMS conveys "what" needs to be accomplished, but not
prescriptively "how" to do it. EPA defines PBMS as a set of processes
wherein the data needs, mandates, or limitations of a program or project
are specified, and serve as criteria for selecting appropriate methods
to meet those needs in a cost-effective manner. The criteria may be
published in regulations, technical guidance documents, permits, work
plans, or enforcement orders. Under a performance-based approach, EPA
would specify:

-   Questions to be answered by monitoring.
-   Decisions to be supported by the data.
-   Level of uncertainty acceptable for making decisions.
-   Documentation to be generated to support this approach in the RCRA
    monitoring program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why use a Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS)?  

In 1997, the Agency adopted the Performance Based Measurement System
(PBMS) (i.e., Federal Register Notice of Intent) to:

-   Reduce the cost of monitoring;
-   Stimulate the development and use of innovative technologies;
-   Speed up the introduction of new methods; and
-   Improve the quality of science in the monitoring community.

Unfortunately, the "one size fits all" approach did not work for the
diversely different programs and authority within each Agency office.
The guidance document "Flexible Approaches to Environmental
Measurement", created in 2008 shifted the focus from the performance
approach to a more flexible one. Documentation on the Agency's
commitment to this flexible approach can be found on the
EPA's [Environmental Measurements and
Modeling](/measurements/method-development#flex) page.
