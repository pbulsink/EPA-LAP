# SW-846 Test Method 1310B: Extraction Procedure (EP) Toxicity Test Method and Structural Integrity Test  


The following document outlines the procedure used to determine whether
a waste exhibits the characteristic of EP Toxicity or to simulate the
leaching which a waste may undergo if disposed of in a sanitary
landfill.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
