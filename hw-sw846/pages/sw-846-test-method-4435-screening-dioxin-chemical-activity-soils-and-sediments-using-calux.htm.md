# SW-846 Test Method 4435: Screening For Dioxin-Like Chemical Activity In Soils And Sediments Using The Calux Bioassay And Toxic Equivalents (TEQs) Determinations  


This method is a bio-analytical screening procedure for dioxin-like
compounds in soils and sediments. This method is based on the ability of
dioxin and related chemicals to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), a chemical-responsive DNA-binding protein that is responsible for
producing the toxic and biological effects of these chemicals.
