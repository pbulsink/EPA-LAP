# SW-846 Test Method 4425: Screening Extracts of Environmental Samples for Planar Organic Compounds by a Reporter Gene on a Human Cell Line  


This document provides information on the screening procedure that will
detect the total amount of planar compounds - including polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs),
coplanar polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), and high molecular
weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - in solvent extracts of
environmental samples of soil, sediment, tissue, and water.

    - Method 4425: Screening Extracts of
    Environmental Samples for Planar Organic Compounds (PAHs, PCBs,
    PCDDs/PCDFs) by a Reporter Gene on a Human Cell Line, part of Test
    Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods
