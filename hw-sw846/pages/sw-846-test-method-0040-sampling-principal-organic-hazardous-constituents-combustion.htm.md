# SW-846 Test Method 0040: Sampling of Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents from Combustion Sources Using Tedlar Bags  


The following document outlines the procedure used in the collection of
volatile organic compounds collected from effluent gas samples from
stationary sources using time-integrated evacuated Tedlar bags.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see theÂ [Methods Innovation Rule
