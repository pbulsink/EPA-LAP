# SW-846 Test Method 1311: Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  


The following document provides information on the Toxicity
Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), which is designed to determine
the mobility of both organic and inorganic analytes present in liquid,
solid, and multiphasic wastes.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
page](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule).
