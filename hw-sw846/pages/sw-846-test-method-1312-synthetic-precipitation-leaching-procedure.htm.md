The following document explains the method designed to determine the
mobility of both organic and inorganic analytes present in liquids,
soils, and wastes.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see the [Methods Innovation Rule
