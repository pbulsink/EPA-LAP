# SW-846 Test Method 0050: Isokinetic Hydrogen Chloride and Chlorine Emission Sampling Train  


The following document outlines the procedure used in the collection of
hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine (Cl~2~) in stack gas emission
samples from hazardous waste incinerators and municipal waste
combustors.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see theÂ [Methods Innovation Rule
page](/hw-sw846/final-rule-methods-innovation-rule).
