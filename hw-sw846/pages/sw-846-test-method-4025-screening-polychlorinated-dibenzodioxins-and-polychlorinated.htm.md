# SW-846 Test Method 4025: Screening for Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs) by Immunoassay  


This method is a procedure for the analysis of polychlorinated
dibenzodioxins (PCDDs)Â and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in soil
at 500 parts per trillion (picograms per gram) using a simple one-step
liquid phase oxidative cleanup or, at mid to low ppt levels, using a two
step coupled column cleanup (oxidation and activated carbon binding)
adapted from Method 8290.
