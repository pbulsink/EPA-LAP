The following document outlines the procedure to measure the corrosivity
toward steel of both aqueous and nonaqueous liquid wastes.

This method is an SW-846 Method-Defined Parameter (MDP), meaning that it
may not be modified when used for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) testing. For more information, see theÂ [Methods Innovation Rule
