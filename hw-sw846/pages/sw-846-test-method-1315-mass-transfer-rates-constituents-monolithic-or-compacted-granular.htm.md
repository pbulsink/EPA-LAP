# SW-846 Test Method 1315: Mass Transfer Rates of Constituents in Monolithic or Compacted Granular Materials Using a Semi-Dynamic Tank Leaching Procedure  


This method is one of four Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework
(LEAF) methods. It is designed to provide the mass transfer rates
(release rates) of inorganic analytes contained in a monolithic or
compacted granular material, under diffusion-controlled release
conditions, as a function of leaching time.

More information about the LEAF, including a detailed "How-To" Guide,
can be found on the [LEAF web
page](/hw-sw846/leaching-environmental-assessment-framework-leaf-methods-and-guidance).
