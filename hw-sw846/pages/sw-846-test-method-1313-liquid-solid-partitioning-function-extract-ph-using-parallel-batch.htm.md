# SW-846 Test Method 1313: Liquid-Solid Partitioning as a Function of Extract pH Using a Parallel Batch Extraction Procedure  


This method is one of four Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework
(LEAF) methods. ItÂ is designed to provide aqueous extracts representing
the liquid/solid partitioning (LSP) curve as a function of pH for
inorganic constituents, semi-volatile organic constituents, and
non-volatile organic constituents in solid materials.

More information about the LEAF, including a detailed "How-To" Guide,
can be found on the [LEAF web
page](/hw-sw846/leaching-environmental-assessment-framework-leaf-methods-and-guidance).
