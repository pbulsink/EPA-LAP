EPA conducts scientific evaluations of new analytical methods for
possible inclusion in [The SW-846
Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium) if the methods:

-   Offer cost-effective alternatives
-   Provide "green chemistry" alternatives or considerations
-   Significantly improve data quality
-   Are expected to find broad application in environmental monitoring

## EPA's Role in Method Development

The EPA Methods Team supports the development of new environmental
measurement or monitoring technologies by:

-   Assisting developers in designing proof of concept studies
-   Hosting forums to facilitate the exchange of ideas between method
    developers and users
-   Assisting method developers in designing evaluation studies prior to
    submitting an approval application

## Method Developers and the Approval Process

Method developers hoping for an EPA review should follow the procedures
in the guidance documents to help speed up the method approval process.
When a method is completed and ready for review, the method developer
should assemble a package of documents including:

-   An electronic copy of the method, adhering to the [SW-846 Style
    Guide](/hw-sw846/sw-846-method-style-guide)
-   Supporting documentation describing the rationale behind the method
    development effort
-   A data package containing both the raw and summarized
    single-laboratory and multi-laboratory data
-   Any diagrams of specific equipment and instrument results (e.g.,
    chromatograms or spectra) pertinent to the demonstration of
    appropriate performance for the intended application
-   Electronic copies of any references listed in the method
-   Any method-specific quality control criteria

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Method Evaluation Criteria for SW-846

EPA uses the following criteria when evaluating a new method for SW-846:

-   Is there a need for the intended scope and application of the
    method?
-   Will the submitted method generate data consistent with the intended
    scope and application?
-   Have appropriate quality control procedures been developed?
-   Is there an existing or anticipated Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act (RCRA) regulatory need for the method?
-   Is the method significantly different in principle or approach from
    existing SW-846 method?
