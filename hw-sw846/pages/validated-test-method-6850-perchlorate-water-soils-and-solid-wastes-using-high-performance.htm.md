# Validated Test Method 6850: Perchlorate in Water, Soils and Solid Wastes Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Electrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC/ESI/MS or HPLC/ESI/MS/MS)  


The following document details the method that uses HPLC coupled with
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) or tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine perchlorate levels in surface water,
groundwater, wastewater, salt water and soil. This method has been
validated and is available for use but has not yet been formally in
incorporated into [the SW-846 Compendium](/hw-sw846/sw-846-compendium).
Please refer to the [SW-846 Validated Methods
page](/hw-sw846/validated-test-methods-recommended-waste-testing) for
more information.
