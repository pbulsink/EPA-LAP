#  General

EPA received many questions about hazardous waste test methods. The questions and responses for this category are listed below.

## How can I find out which is the most recent version of an SW-846 method?

It is usually best to use the most up-to-date version of a method. Although the validated methods are not officially incorporated into SW-846, they have gone through an extensive review process and are recommended for use whenever possible. However, certain state regulations may restrict which versions of methods can be used so you should check with your state or EPA Regional Office to confirm which version of a method to use.

The simplest way is to consult the SW-846 Methods Status Table. This table shows the chronological progression of new and revised methods in SW-846 by: listing each method in numerical order, showing in which update to the Third Edition the method appeared, providing the method title, and listing the most recent version.
Where in SW-846 can I find a method for total organic carbon (TOC) in soil and other solid matrices?

There is no SW-846 method for TOC in soils. The Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) does not have any regulatory requirements that govern the total organic carbon content of soils or solid matrices. Therefore, without a regulatory driver, there is no need for a method for TOC in soil in SW-846. Scientists in Europe and North America have developed a variety of methods for TOC over the years. Some of them are based on titration of "easily oxidizable organic carbon," while others involve the high temperature combustion of any organic carbon in the soil and measurement of the resulting carbon dioxide. If you need a method for TOC in soil, you can google to find available test procedures and consult with your regulator or data user to see which procedure(s) is more appropriate for your intended application.

## What is the status of Update VI to SW-846?

When will these methods be finalized?

The Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery is currently working on Update VI to SW-846. The Agency plans to publish Update VI in three phases: Update VIA, Update VIB, and Update VIC, where one phase will include several organic methods (e.g., 8260D and 8270E), another phase will include several inorganic methods (e.g., 3050C and 6200A), and the remaining phase will include LEAF methods 1313, 1314, 1315, and 1316 along with a LEAF guidance document. Publication dates and specific methods are not certain, but publication will likely not occur before the calendar year 2016.

## What is the current process to promulgate SW-846 test methods?

I understand the process has changed in promulgating SW-846 test methods. How are they promulgated? When are they finally approved for use?

Currently, many RCRA regulations specifically require the use of SW-846 methods. Methods are added to the SW-846 methods compendium by two ways. Required methods are added to SW-846 through a formal rulemaking process, in which the Agency follows the Action Development Process (ADP), through which the agency seeks notice and comment. After the comments are reviewed, the required method may be revised, based on public comment. Then Agency will finalized the methods with a Final rule after the designated comment period. Only after a final rule is published are methods approved for use by the regulated community in order to comply with RCRA regulations requiring the use of finalized SW-846 methods. States may choose to adopt the required method(s).

For all other methods considered guidance, updates to SW-846 are announced through a Notice of Availability (NOA). These validated methods are made available to the public for comment. After comments are evaluated, the agency will revise the method update appropriately. Once the methods are finalized, the update is incorporated into the SW-846 method compendium.

## Use of non-required test methods for compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations in relation to the Methods Innovation Rule (MIR).

If the analysis that you wish to perform is not for one of the Method Defined Parameters (MDPs) listed in 40 CFR §260.11, then you must determine whether a method (whether SW-846 or not) is appropriate for the analytical purpose. The Agency has written the following guidance in the MIR for determining method appropriateness:

An appropriate method might be one published by:

    - EPA in a different manual or regulation;
    - Another government agency;
    - A voluntary standards setting organization; or
    - Other well-known source.

Appropriate methods are reliable and accepted as such in the scientific community. These methods might include those published by the Agency or other government entities using techniques that have documented reliability (e.g., ASTM).

Appropriate methods generate effective data, known and of appropriate quality for project-specific decisions.

When selecting an appropriate method to use, you must be able to demonstrate and document that you are able to see the analyte of concern, in the matrix of concern, at the level of concern.

In addition, before selecting an alternative method other than SW-846 for RCRA-related testing and monitoring activities, we recommend that you discuss your plans with your regulating authority and the project managers.

## How can I find a list of current SW-846 test methods?

The simplest way to find the current finalized version of a method is to consult the on-line version of SW-846.

SW-846 Online contains the current finalized SW-846 methods that the regulated community must use to comply with any regulations requiring the use of specific finalized SW-846 methods.

Another way to determine the most current version of an SW-846 method is to consult the SW-846 Methods Status Table. This table shows the chronological progression of new and revised methods in SW-846 by: listing each method in numerical order, showing in which update to the Third Edition the method appeared, providing the method title, and listing the most recent version.

It is usually best to use the most up-to-date version of a method. Although the validated methods are not officially incorporated into SW-846, they have gone through an extensive review process and are recommended for use whenever possible. However, certain state regulations may restrict which versions of methods can be used so you should check with your state or EPA Regional Office to confirm which version of a method to use.

## How can I find a copy of the protocol for the TCLP test (Method 1311) in SW-846?

The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), which is used for determining whether a solid waste is a hazardous waste by exhibiting the characteristic of toxicity, is Method 1311. A copy of Method 1311 is available here: www.epa.gov/hw-sw846/sw-846-test-method-1311-toxicity-characteristic-leaching-procedure

SW-846 is available for on-line at no cost. Visit SW-846: Test Method 1311: Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure for the entire SW-846 method compendium.

Other Category: Hazardous Waste Characteristics

## How should I reference an SW-846 method?

There are two ways to reference SW‐846 methods. You can reference the entire methods compendium as follows: Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, EPA publication SW‐846, Third Edition, Final Updates I (1993), II (1995), IIA (1994), IIB (1995), III (1997), IIIA (1999), IIIB (2005), IV (2008), and V (2015).

If you want a separate reference for each method, use this format: Method xxxxx, Revision x, Month Year, Final Update x to the Third Edition of the Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, EPA publication SW‐846.

For example, Method 3060A would be: Method 3060A, Revision 1, December 1996, Final Update III to the Third Edition of the Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, EPA publication SW‐846.

You can use the Methods Status Table to find the dates and related Update version of specific methods.

## What do the letters after the method number mean?

The letters following a method number (i.e., 3060A) refer to the number of revisions a method has undergone. The letter does not indicate a separate method. In the example above, Method 3060 and Method 3060A are the same method, but Method 3060A is an updated/revised version.

## Why is the method I’m looking for not in SW-846?

If the method you’re looking for has a number with the format XXX or XXX.X (e.g., Method 624 or Method 200.8), it is a water method promulgated by the EPA Office of Water either for the Clean Water Act (CWA) or for the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). These methods can be found on the Clean Water Act Analytical Methods website and the Safe Drinking Water Act Analytical Methods website.

If you are looking for a 1600 series method (method 1600-1682), it is a Clean Water Act method and is not part of SW-846.

Additional environmental monitoring methods can be found on the EPA Environmental Measurement website.

## How can I find out when SW-846 updates are available?

To find out when methods go out for comment or when Updates are finalized and incorporated into SW-846, please sign up for our mailing list.

## Where can I find methods out for comment?

You can sign up for the SW-846 mailing list to receive email notifications when new methods or SW-846 Updates are released to the public for comment.

## Which version of a method should I use?

It is usually best to use the most up-to-date version of a method. Although the validated methods are not officially incorporated into SW-846, they have gone through an extensive review process and are recommended for use whenever possible. However, certain state regulations may restrict which versions of methods can be used so you should check with your state or EPA Regional Office to confirm which version of a method to use.

## Do the "flexible approach", performance based measurement system (PBMS), and/or Methods Innovation Rule (MIR) change the way prescriptive language is interpreted in SW-846 methods?

The following statement from the Disclaimer for SW-846 provides specific guidance for interpretation of must, should, etc.:

"EPA generally does not intend these methods to be overly prescriptive. The words "shall," "must," or "require" are used to indicate aspects of the method that are considered essential to its performance, based on sound analytical practices (e.g., an instrument must be calibrated before use). In contrast, the words "should," "may," or "recommend" are used to provide guidance on aspects of the method that are useful but not essential. This flexibility does not apply to those Method Defined Parameters where the analytical result is wholly dependent on the process used to make the measurement."

## In SW-846 Method 3620C Section 11.13.4, is 0.035 the correct elution amount for acetonitrile?

Section 11.13.4 of Method 3620C states, "Elute the column with 60 mL of methylene chloride / acetonitrile / hexane (50/0.035/49.65, v/v/v), collecting the eluate in a second flask. This is Fraction 2." If the middle number were 0.35 instead of 0.035, the total of the three would be 100. Is this just a typo?

This typo has been fixed in the Update V version of the method, "Method 3620C: Florisil Cleanup".

## Decay equation for Radium-228 in SW-846 Method 9320.

I was recently recalculating laboratory results for Ra‐228 from a laboratory using a slightly modified version of Method 9320, using the calculation on page 5. Using this equation, I was not able to duplicate the results that the laboratory reported. However, when I multiplied the t1 and t3 time by the decay constant, I was able to duplicate the results.

The equation in older versions of SW-846 Method 9320 is misprinted. The error has been fixed in the Update V version of the method, "Method 9320: Radium 228, part of Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods". Any decay equation requires the incorporation of the decay constant, lambda, which is ln2/half-life.

## Is there anywhere I can see a list of the changes between the updated version and the previous version?

Is there anywhere I can see a list of the changes between the updated version and the previous version?

While no published document exists contrasting the differences between two method versions, all newly updated methods include Appendix A, which summarizes method changes from the previous versions. This appendix will be used for future method updates as well. In the absence of this appendix, a manual comparison would have to be made.

## Where can I find older versions of SW-846 methods?

Where can I find older versions of SW-846 methods? For example, where can I find Method 5030A (Method 5030C is the current version)?

Older versions of some methods are available via Internet searches or they are formally available through the National Technical Information Service: www.ntis.gov/products/sw846/.

Please note that EPA’s Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery strongly recommends using the most recent version of all SW‐846 methods whenever possible.

## Method 1315, and other validated methods, isn't listed in the 1000 Series of the SW-846 Online webpage, why isn't it there and where can I find it?

Validated methods that haven’t been officially incorporated into SW-846 can be found on the Validated Test Methods Recommended for Waste Testing page. These methods have been validated and approved for use, but have not been through the public comment period. SW-846 users are encouraged to use these methods whenever possible.

## When EPA releases new updates to SW-846, and a general method is updated, are all methods in that series impacted by the update?

When the EPA releases new updates to SW-846, and a general method, for example Method 8000, is updated, in this case to 8000D, are all 8000 series methods impacted by the update? For example, is Method 8260C affected by changes presented in 8000D? Can Method 8260C be used in conjunction with 8000D?

Method 8000D (the current version in Update V) is a general guidance method. Other general methods in SW-846 are 3500, 3600, 5000, and 7000. These methods represent the most up-to-date guidance on general techniques such as chromatography and sample preparation in SW-846. The determinative methods (such as Method 8260C) are much more specific in their requirements and the determinative method's criteria supersede any general guidance found in 8000D or Chapter 1, if specific conflicts exist.

The older, published methods (such as 8260B and 8000C) are still valid choices and may still be followed by those with a need to do so. We recommend using the newest version of any SW-846 method, unless your regulator or customer require you to use an earlier version.

Other category: 8000 Series

## There is an EPA 8015D (Revision 2003) and also an EPA 8015C (Revision 2007). Which of these two methods is the latest/updated version?

Method 8015C is an official, approved method that was formally included in the SW‐846 via a Federal Register Notice whereas Method 8015D is posted on the RCRA Methods website, considered as “validated” for public use and comment to be later finalized. The process for publishing validated methods for inclusion in SW‐846 takes time, and the two methods (i.e., Methods 8015C and 8015D) took slightly different paths before they were published online, resulting in a later publication date for Method 8015C. The differences between the methods are minimal. Therefore, they should yield similar results.

Other category: 8000 Series

## How do method updates work, e.g., how significant is the difference between SW‐846 Method 8270C versus 8270D?

ORCR employs a specific naming convention (i.e., method number and letter suffix) when publishing methods. The naming convention is intended to minimize confusion within the user community regarding a method’s developmental status. The method number designates the underlying technology (e.g., 8000 series methods designate determinative procedures for organic compounds). A revision to a method where the underlying technology does not change is indicated by continued use of the same method number and letter, but with a new issuance date.

If the revision retains the underlying technology, but does not affect the precision and/or accuracy of the data, the revision is considered to be minor or non-significant and the method number and letter is not changed or sequenced. If, on the other hand, the revision retains the underlying technology, but changes the precision and/or accuracy of the data, the change is considered to be significant and is indicated by a subsequent letter suffix (e.g., changes from 8270C to 8270D) and a new issuance date. For example, if the quality control recommendations are changed in a manner that improves the bias or precision of the method, but does not change the underlying technology (e.g., a tightening of the calibration acceptance criteria), the method number stays the same, but the letter suffix is sequenced to the next letter. The differences between the earlier and later versions of a method are detailed in the method summary section of the revised version regardless of the type of change.

Examples of changes that may be considered minor or non-significant include, but are not limited to: Language added to a method to provide increased clarity or guidance; expansion of lists of acceptable instrumentation, applicability of the method to a matrix not previously referenced, adding new compounds to the list of applicable compounds, or changes to instrument specifications which do not result in an existing acceptable instrument being rendered unacceptable; or formatting and editorial changes that are designed to improve readability or correct spelling or grammatical errors.

ORCR has defined a ‘‘significant change’’ as a change that results in improved analytical results (e.g., changes that result in reducing analytical bias or improving data precision). Examples of significant changes may include, but are not limited to: a change in the operating parameter which reduces analytical flexibility; a change in instrumentation specification which minimizes interference and/or optimizes instrument performance (if the use of such interference reduction technique or performance enhancement is required); a change in calibration guidance which results in more restrictive recommendations; a change that institutes tighter QC recommendations; or a change in the reagents that are required by the method.

ORCR strongly advises that laboratories use the latest version of a SW-846 method whenever possible, especially in new monitoring situations, since updated versions of methods generally are either less subject to misinterpretation, yield improved precision and/or bias or provide for the use of newer and, often, more cost effective technologies, and may be greener (e.g., generate less waste). In situations where it may not be appropriate to use the latest method in SW-846, earlier versions may be used. These may include, but are not limited to, situations where an earlier version of a method is required for existing permits, consent decrees, waste analysis plans or sampling analysis plans. The Agency does not impose restrictions on the use of earlier versions of non-required methods contained in SW-846 or preclude the use of previous guidance. Nonetheless, the adoption of the latest method version is recommended and should be accomplished as soon as possible, as appropriate. When methods are employed, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the method yields data of a quality appropriate for that particular application.

## Does EPA have a validation protocol that should be followed when modifying a method or evaluating a proposed modification?

Does EPA have a validation protocol that should be followed when modifying a method or evaluating a proposed modification?

In general, SW-846 is considered guidance with the exception of Methods Defined Parameters (MDPs). SW-846 does not have to be used for analyzing waste under RCRA unless the regulation requires a specific method for analyses and compliance. A list of the required MDPs can be found in 40 CFR Part 260.11.

ORCR does allow “appropriate modifications”. However, the responsibility is on the laboratory to demonstrate the applicability and appropriateness of all modifications. It has always been ORCR’s policy to recommend that the analyst document any/all changes and seek approval from their regulated authority (e.g., Region or State) before initiating modification to any methods, as stated in SW-846. By seeking approval, the analyst has a documented and approved change, if granted, in their Quality Assurance Project Plan or Sampling Analysis Plan. Several ORCR Federal Register notices have explained this. See: The Methods Innovation Rule (MIR) (70FR34538, June 14, 2005, page 34543-44) and Update V of SW-846 (78 FR, No. 205, October 23, 2013, page 63189).

Find guidance on submitting new methods for RCRA  here, however, we do not have specific guidance for methods modifications unless the user is seeking “equivalency”. There is a process to petition the EPA Administrator to seek equivalency for a method, although the RCRA program does not follow these guidelines. Guidance on the Equivalency Petition process can be found in 40 CFR §260.21, and more information can be found at Drinking Water Alternate Test Procedure Program and Clean Water Act Alternate Test Procedures. In addition, there are other methods that may be appropriate in addressing what the lab is trying to accomplish.

When a lab proposes a modification to a non-MDP method under the flexibility clause, its scope should be limited to the type of sample for which they have demonstrated performance, and not apply to all samples. If they offer demonstrated performance on a wider variety of samples, then the applicability of the modification can be expanded.

The lab's regulatory authority has the power to approve or disapprove a given modification if it believes the lab has failed to demonstrate adequate performance, and appropriateness for a given application, sample matrix, or site. It may be relatively easy to demonstrate performance for a given type of sample, but it is very difficult to demonstrate adequate performance for all sample types. In the same manner, we have not validated a method for all sample types. However, some USGS or ASTM methods may be appropriate, although we have not included them in SW-846. Science has a wide range, and having an approved, appropriate, well documented study will always reduce ambiguity and have greater credibility in court.

## Differences in quality control (QC), preservation, and holding time recommendations among SW-846 parts.

When there are differences in the QC recommendations between Chapter One, a general method (e.g. 8000), and a determinative method (e.g. 8082), what is the proper precedence? Would recommendations for preservation and holding time follow the same precedence as QC?

The precedence for holding time and preservation is the same as that for QC. According to Chapter Two of SW-846, QC guidance specific to a given analytical technique (e.g., extraction, cleanup, sample introduction, or analysis) may be found in general methods 3500, 3600, 5000, 7000, and 8000

When inconsistencies exist between the information in a chapter, a general method, or a specific method, method-specific QC criteria take precedence over both criteria found in the general method and those criteria given in Chapter One. QC criteria in general methods take precedence over the criteria in Chapter One.

Other Categories: QA/QC, Holding Time & Preservation

## Where can a history of the SW-846 Method Updates be found?

A complete list of SW‐846 methods and their revision histories can be found in the current version of the SW-846 Methods Status Table.

## How is SW-846 structured?

This manual consists of thirteen chapters providing guidance on using the manual, analytical methods divided into eight ‘series’ depending on the analyte/technique, and supporting documents. In general, you should read through the chapters before using the methods to ensure competency.

## What is the purpose of SW-846?

Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, also known as (SW-846), provides a unified, up-to-date source of information on sampling and analysis related to compliance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. It brings together into one reference all sampling and testing methodologies approved by the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) for use in implementing the RCRA regulatory program. The manual provides methodologies for collecting and testing representative samples of waste and other materials to be monitored. Aspects of sampling and testing in SW-846 include quality control, sampling plan development and implementation, analysis of inorganic and organic constituents, the estimation of intrinsic physical properties, and the appraisal of waste characteristics.

The procedures described in this manual are meant to be comprehensive and detailed, coupled with the realization that the problems encountered in sampling and analytical situations require a certain amount of flexibility. The solutions to these problems will depend, in part, on the skill, training, and experience of the analyst. For some situations, it is possible to use this manual in rote fashion. In other situations, it will require a combination of technical abilities, using the manual as guidance rather than in a step-by-step, word-by-word fashion.

## What is SW-846?

What is SW-846?

Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods (SW-846) is a manual that provides test procedures and guidance which are recommended for use in conducting the evaluations and measurements needed to comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Public Law 94-580, as amended. The methods and other documents included in SW-846 are approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for obtaining data to satisfy the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 122 through 270 promulgated under RCRA, as amended. The manual presents the state-of-the-art in routine analytical testing adapted for the RCRA program. It contains procedures for field and laboratory quality control, sampling, determining hazardous constituents in wastes, determining the hazardous characteristics of wastes (toxicity, ignitability, reactivity, and corrosivity), and determining physical properties of wastes. It also contains guidance on how to select appropriate methods.

Several of the hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of RCRA require that specific testing methods described in SW-846 be employed for certain applications. Refer to 40 CFR Parts 260 through 270, for those specific requirements. Any reliable analytical method may be used to meet other requirements under Subtitle C of RCRA.
