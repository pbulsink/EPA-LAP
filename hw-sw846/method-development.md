# SW-846 Method Development

EPA conducts scientific evaluations of new analytical methods for possible inclusion in The SW-846 Compendium if the methods:

    - Offer cost-effective alternatives
    - Provide “green chemistry” alternatives or considerations
    - Significantly improve data quality
    - Are expected to find broad application in environmental monitoring

## EPA’s Role in Method Development

The EPA Methods Team supports the development of new environmental measurement or monitoring technologies by:

    - Assisting developers in designing proof of concept studies
    - Hosting forums to facilitate the exchange of ideas between method developers and users
    - Assisting method developers in designing evaluation studies prior to submitting an approval application

## Method Developers and the Approval Process

Method developers hoping for an EPA review should follow the procedures in the guidance documents to help speed up the method approval process. When a method is completed and ready for review, the method developer should assemble a package of documents including:

    - An electronic copy of the method, adhering to the SW-846 Style Guide
    - Supporting documentation describing the rationale behind the method development effort
    - A data package containing both the raw and summarized single-laboratory and multi-laboratory data
    - Any diagrams of specific equipment and instrument results (e.g., chromatograms or spectra) pertinent to the demonstration of appropriate performance for the intended application
    - Electronic copies of any references listed in the method
    - Any method-specific quality control criteria

## Method Evaluation Criteria for SW-846

EPA uses the following criteria when evaluating a new method for SW-846:

    - Is there a need for the intended scope and application of the method?
    - Will the submitted method generate data consistent with the intended scope and application?
    - Have appropriate quality control procedures been developed?
    - Is there an existing or anticipated Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulatory need for the method?
    - Is the method significantly different in principle or approach from existing SW-846 method?
