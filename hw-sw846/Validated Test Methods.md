# Validated Test Methods Recommended for Waste Testing 

## Validated Test Methods

EPA and independent laboratories validated the following methods, which are recommended for use as the most up-to-date methods available. However, these methods have not been formally incorporated into the SW-846 Compendium through the public comment process. While many of the following methods may be added to SW-846 in the future, authorized states may have regulatory restrictions regarding which version of a method can be used.

Therefore, EPA recommends checking with your state or EPA regional office before using the following methods.
