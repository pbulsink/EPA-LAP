# 6PPD-q Using Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) - Method 1634 (Not yet approved)  

[Method]  1634 measures 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-q) using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy. This method is not yet approved at [40 CFR Part 136](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-136).

## Background

Used for more than six decades as an additive in tires, 6PPD (chemical
name: N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine) is also found
in other rubber products such as footwear, synthetic turf infill, and
synthetic playground surfaces. 6PPD reacts with ozone in the air to form
6PPD-quinone (6PPD-q), which research funded by the EPA in 2020 found to
be linked to the deaths of coho salmon in urban Puget Sound streams.
Exposures occur when runoff containing the chemical is washed from
parking lots and streets into streams and other bodies of water.

## Draft Method 1634

The EPA's Office of Water, in partnership with the EPA's Region 10
office and Eurofins Environment Testing -- Sacramento, has published
Draft Method 1634, an analytical procedure to test for 6PPD-q in surface
water and stormwater.

Widespread availability of a draft EPA analytical method for 6PPD-q
provides Tribes and local governments with an important tool for better
understanding stormwater and surface water quality, and to inform how
and where to put in place protections for sensitive salmon, trout, and
other aquatic life from potentially dangerous run-off. The Agency's
draft testing method now is available for use.

The Office of Water encourages laboratories, regulatory authorities, and
other interested parties to review and use the draft method, with the
understanding that it is subject to revision.

The EPA is grateful for the constructive feedback received from multiple
interested parties to date. If stakeholders identify additional areas
that need clarification, they may be incorporated in future revisions.
