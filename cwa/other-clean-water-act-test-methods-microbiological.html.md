# Other Clean Water Act Test Methods: Microbiological  

## Not Approved Under 40 CFR Part 136

In addition to developing and approving methods for use in compliance monitoring, the EPA may develop methods to support studies of specific industries (e.g., the [Effluent Guidelines program](/eg)) or for use in broad national surveys. If such studies or surveys lead to regulatory limits of new contaminants, the EPA approves the applicable methods for nationwide or industry-specific use through rulemaking which includes an opportunity for public comment.

Although the following methods are not in EPA regulations, they may be of interest to regulated entities, permitting authorities, and the public. The presence of a method here does not imply a regulatory requirement for its use.

## Microbial Source Tracking Methods

[Methods]  1696.1 and 1697.2 are used for microbial source tracking (MST) to characterize human sources of fecal pollution in recreational waters. These methods can be used to identify trends and provide additional information to support water quality management that can potentially improve public health and water quality.

Methods 1696.1 and 1697.2 include an update to the optical density at 260 nm (OD~260~) example calculation in Section 7.18 (Salmon DNA Extraction Buffer) to 33 µg/mL from the original versions of these methods. It should also be noted that the automated data analysis tool has been updated to allow for the use of commercially available DNA standards.
