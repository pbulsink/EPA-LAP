# Other Clean Water Act Test Methods: Chemical  

## Not Approved Under 40 CFR Part 136

In addition to developing and approving methods for use in compliance monitoring, the EPA may develop methods to support studies of specific industries (e.g., the [Effluent Guidelines program](/eg)) or for use in broad national surveys. If such studies or surveys lead to regulatory limits of new contaminants, the EPA approves the applicable methods for nationwide or industry-specific use through rulemaking which includes an opportunity for public comment.

Although the following methods are not in regulations developed by the EPA, they may be of interest to regulated entities, permitting authorities, and the public. The presence of a method here does not imply a regulatory requirement for its use.
