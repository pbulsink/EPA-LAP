# Approved Industry-Specific CWA Test Methods  

In addition to [general purpose methods](/cwa-methods/approved-cwa-chemical-test-methods), the EPA has approved special purpose analytical methods. These methods were developed to work in samples or for pollutants specific to certain industrial categories. For example, methods specific to the [Pharmaceutical Manufacturing](/eg/pharmaceutical-manufacturing-effluent-guidelines) and [Pesticide Chemicals](/eg/pesticide-chemicals-effluent-guidelines) Effluent Guidelines categories are listed in Tables I-F and I-G, respectively, at [40 CFR Part 136](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-136).

Methods specific to other industrial categories are listed or incorporated by reference into the regulations at 40 CFR Parts 401 through 503. These include methods specific to the [Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard category](/eg/pulp-paper-and-paperboard-effluent-guidelines) ([40 CFR Part 430](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-N/part-430)), and specific to [Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge (biosolids)](/biosolids) ([40 CFR Part 503](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-O/part-503)). Industry-specific methods that are approved for compliance monitoring in the industry for which they are designated may be used for general use, if the same method is listed in Tables I-A to I-E, or I-H at [40 CFR 136.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-136#136.3).
